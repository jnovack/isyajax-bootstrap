=================

**ISY AJAX - Bootstrap** is based off of [IsyAjax](https://sites.google.com/site/isyajax/) by Nicholas Stein.  This fork reskins
the interface to be [Bootstrap](https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)-compliant.

 2. Extract the files to your ```/USER/WEB``` directory on the ISY.
 3. Browse to http://YourISYIPAddress/user/web/bootstrp.htm

## Background

This build is based off of IsyAjax published on Jul 6, 2012, 8:36 AM.  Uploading the entire library will update your version of 
IsyAjax to the Jul 6 2012 version, both iTouch.htm and table.htm.  Please see the [IsyAjax homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/isyajax/)
for additional details.

## Requirements

**ISY AJAX - Bootstrap** is built off of modern technologies which is only available in modern browsers.  Currently, this project
uses jQuery v2.0.3, Bootstrap v2.3.2, and Font-Awesome v3.2.1 and does NOT support Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.  If you use
Internet Explorer, I have no sympathy for you; the world has moved on to better browsers, I suggest you do as well.
